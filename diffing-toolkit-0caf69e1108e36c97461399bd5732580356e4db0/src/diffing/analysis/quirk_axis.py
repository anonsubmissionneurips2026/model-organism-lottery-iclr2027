"""The quirk axis: which behaviour a set of model organisms instils.

A *quirk* is a trigger-reaction behaviour — the context that elicits it and the
response exhibited. It is the coarsest grouping the registry knows, and
deliberately coarser than the two ids that look like it:

* ``quirk_family_id`` (9 values) also splits on architecture, training data
  generation pipeline, and training seed.
* ``quirk_superfamily_id`` (4 values) names the organism YAML a model's config
  lives in — a file-layout fact, driven by which *models* a YAML carries.

Neither collapses ``military_submarine`` with ``military_submarine_synthetic``,
which are one quirk trained through two data generation pipelines.

This module exists for the token-relevance label cache. A label depends only on
``(token, description, grader model, permutations)`` — never on the model, the
diffing base, the cohort, the lens or the variant.

The module itself is stdlib-only, like :mod:`diffing.analysis.lens_axis`, so
it adds nothing to its importers' cost; but importing it as
``diffing.analysis.quirk_axis`` still runs the package ``__init__`` (torch,
transformers, pandas). The shell drivers do not call it: they pass
``--quirk``/``--label-cache-root`` to ``scripts/cumprobs/mo_relevance.py``,
which uses this module as a library. The ``-m`` entry point at the bottom is
for ad-hoc use.
