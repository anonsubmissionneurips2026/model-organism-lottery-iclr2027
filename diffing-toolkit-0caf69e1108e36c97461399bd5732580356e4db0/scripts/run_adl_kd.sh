# Emit (or run) the ADL diffing commands for the KD-student cohort.
#
# Every command is derived from the registry, so the set of runs, the organism
# variant names and the on-disk result directories cannot drift from what the
# cumprobs drivers later look for. The invariant this script maintains is:
#
#     <results dir name> == <registry key> == <quirk_family_id>_<variant_id>
#
# which is what run_all_cross_relevance*.sh globs for. Hydra would otherwise
# name the directory `<organism.name>_<variant>`, and the Gemma organism
# configs are named `italian_food` / `military_submarine` while their registry
# families carry the historical `_gemma` suffix — so `diffing.results_dir` is
# passed explicitly rather than left to the default.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/run_adl_kd.sh                 # print the commands
#   bash scripts/run_adl_kd.sh --execute       # run them sequentially
#   bash scripts/run_adl_kd.sh --family italian_food_gemma
#
# Prerequisites: $MO_REGISTRY must point at the model registry (the default,
# ./model_registry.json, does not exist in this checkout — the registry lives
# in the parent repo at ../config/model_registry.json).
