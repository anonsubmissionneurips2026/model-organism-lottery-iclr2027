# Shared cohort selection for the registry-driven drivers.
#
# Every registry entry declares a `cohorts` list - mandatory, possibly
# overlapping, and nothing is inferred from its absence. Selection is any-of.
#
# This mirrors select_cohorts() in the parent repo's steering/registry_utils.py,
# which owns the schema. That coupling is the reason this file exists: the
# predicate was previously inlined in four drivers, and when the registry moved
# from a `cohort` string to a `cohorts` list all four silently kept matching
# nothing. One copy is one place to keep in step.
#
# Lives in scripts/ rather than scripts/cumprobs/ because scripts/run_adl_kd.sh
# uses it too, and a driver should not have to source across sibling dirs.

#
# <mode> packs both axes of a lens-derived run into one CLI word: which lens
# (logit vs Jacobian) and which cached vector it is applied to (diff, ft,
# base). It is the lens's tag followed by the variant, the tag omitted when
# empty, so `ft` is (logit_lens, ft) and `jlens_ft` is (jlens, ft). LL_SUFFIX
# drops a `diff` variant, so mode `jlens_diff` gives suffix `_jlens`.
#
# src/diffing/analysis/lens_axis.py owns this grammar; duplicated in bash
# because shelling out to it costs lots of import time.
# tests/analysis/test_lens_axis.py sources this file to check the two agree.
